Action Points

1. Enric to make his point in an email to everyone explaining the point and requiring clarifications, modifications and additions (e.g. with Bert)....just for the General Comments, for the time beingxsxs
2. Define the meaning of "Sytle Guide" in the introduction "What do mean by Style Guide and what is the type of content the targeted reader should expect and which this target audience"
3. In respect of the Guidelines, start with the General Comments
4. Style Guide, section on PURIs, additional elaboration should be added to explain how PURIS will be resolved into SEMIC URIs. Explain that similarly a national authority managing PURIs could use this approach (and examples) as a reference to build up their own PURI -> URI policy management and dereferencing. BECAUSE THESE GUIDELINES ARE INTENDED TO BE USED BY ANY PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION.
5. Criteria for the Reusability, e.g. how to solve the CCTS URN
6. Guideline 105 --> The issue Pavlina (and possibly many other readers) may have with this recommendation emerges from this idea:

 "Reused vocabularies probably exist in one single syntax but not in others. When one wants to have the same conceptual model in other syntaxes that do not yet exist one should "copy" (reuse) the same primitive data into the new syntax. But this is not always possible. ....Explain why and how to work around this problem."
