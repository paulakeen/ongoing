This folder is inteded to collect all the materials produced during the development of the project, aimed at producing final documentary artefacts, e.g. online HTML or MarkDown, PDF, MS Word or other manifestations reporting how the development was approached and developed.

Typically a final Project Development Report is created where all the materials reunited in this folder are organised around the development storyline and narrative.

The structure of the Development Report is usually built around a Wiki ToC (Table of Content). In the case of this project, the Wiki Too can be found under this Teams' Wiki Workspace:
